# settings for computing the 'signal' and 'noise' time windows on a segment waveform
sn_windows:
  # set the separator between noise part and signal part, in seconds relative to each
  # segment arrival time:
  arrival_time_shift: -2.0
  # define the signal window [start, end] within the signal part (see above). Each number
  # is given as ratio of the total signal sum of squares (so 0.1 is the time when the
  # signal cumulative reaches 10% of the total)
  signal_window: [0.1, 0.9]

# settings for the sn (signal-to-noise) spectra implemented in the associated python module
sn_spectra:
  taper:
    max_percentage: 0.05
    type: 'hann'
  smoothing_wlen_ratio: 0.05  # 0 for no smoothing
  type: 'amp'  # if 'pow', then power spectra are computed, otherwise if 'amp', amplitude spectra are computed

# settings for the pre-process function implemented in the associated python module
preprocess:
  remove_response_water_level: 60
  remove_response_output: 'ACC'
  bandpass_freq_max: 30  # the max frequency, in Hz:
  bandpass_max_nyquist_ratio: 0.9
  bandpass_corners: 2

# settings for the wood-anderson implemented in the associated python module
paz_wa:
  sensitivity: 2800
  zeros:
    - '0j'
  poles:
    - '-6.2832-4.7124j'
    - '-6.2832+4.7124j'
  gain: 1

savitzky_golay:
  wsize: 31  # window size in pts
  order: 4   # polynomial order to use to fit and smooth data
  deriv: 2   # the derivative (1st, second, ...)
