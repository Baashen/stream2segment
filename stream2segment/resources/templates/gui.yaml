# Configuration file for the Stream2segment Graphical User Interface (GUI)
# ========================================================================
#
# This file represent the `config` argument accessible in all gui-decorated functions of
# the associated Python module (stype `s2s show --help` for details). Put here everything
# that is not code-related but is used as parameters to tune the code output
#
# NOTE: This file is written in YAML syntax, which uses Python-style indentation to
# indicate nesting, keep it in mind when editing. You can also use a more compact format
# that uses [] for lists and {} for maps/objects. For info see:

# settings for computing the 'signal' and 'noise' time windows on a segment waveform
sn_windows:
  # set the separator between noise part and signal part, in seconds relative to each
  # segment arrival time:
  arrival_time_shift: -2.0
  # define the signal window [start, end] within the signal part (see above). Each number
  # is given as ratio of the total signal sum of squares (so 0.1 is the time when the
  # signal cumulative reaches 10% of the total)
  signal_window: [0.1, 0.9]

# settings for the sn (signal-to-noise) spectra implemented in the associated python module
sn_spectra:

  smoothing_wlen_ratio: 0.05  # 0 for no smoothing
  type: 'amp'  # if 'pow', then power spectra are computed, otherwise if 'amp', amplitude spectra are computed
