# Stations / Channels: https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.1.pdf#page=10
# ====================

# Limit the search to the specified channels (if missing, defaults to '*', i.e.: accept all channels)
# Wildcards '?' and '*' are recognized (https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.1.pdf),
# as well as the operator '!' placed as first character to indicate logical NOT.
# Example: "!B*,BBB" accepts all channels NOT starting with "B" OR the channel "BBB"
# Implementation details: 'cha' or 'channels' are also valid names for the parameter. You can
# also specify a list/array of strings in yaml format instead of comma-separated strings.
# E.g., these are quivalent:
# channels: "A,B"
# cha: [ "A" , "B" ]
# channel:
#  - "A"
#  - "B"
channel:
 - "HH?"
 - 'HN?'
 - 'HL?'
 
# Limit the search to the specified networks (see 'channel' parameter for details).
# Implementation details: 'net' or 'networks' are also valid names for the parameter.
network: '*'

# Limit the search to the specified stations (see 'channel' parameter for details).
# Implementation details: 'sta' or 'stations' are also valid names for the parameter.
station: '*'

# Limit the search to the specified locations (see 'channel' parameter for details).
# Implementation details: 'loc' or 'locations' are also valid names for the parameter.
location: '*'

# Limit the search to channels with at least the following sample rate (in Hz).
# The relative segments will *mot likely* (but not always) match the channel sample rate.
# Set to 0 or negative number to ignore the sampling rate
min_sample_rate: 60

# Update segments metadata, i.e. overwrite the data of already saved stations and channels.
# Metadata include the station inventories (see 'inventory' for details).
# This parameter does not affect new stations and channels, which will be saved on the db anyway
update_metadata: false

# Download station inventories (xml format). Inventories will be downloaded and saved on the db
# for all stations that have saved segments with data. If the metadata should not be updated
# (see 'update_metadata') already saved inventories will not be downloaded again. You can always
# download inventories later by providing "only" as value (wihtout quotes): this will skip all other
# download steps (and ignore all other parameters values except 'update_metadata')
inventory: true

# search radius: for each event, stations will be searched within a circular area whose radius
# is a linear function of the event magnitude:
#
#                   |
#     maxmag_radius +                oooooooooooo
#                   |              o
#                   |            o
#                   |          o
#     minmag_radius + oooooooo
#                   |
#                   ---------+-------+------------
#                         minmag   maxmag
# Edge cases:
# - if minmag_radius == maxmag_radius = R, this is equivalent to a constant function returning
#   always R regardless of the magnitude
# - if minmag_radius != maxmag_radius and minmag == maxmag = M, this function returns
#   minmag_radius for all magnitudes < M, maxmag_radius for all magnitudes > M, and
#   (minmag_radius + maxmag_radius) / 2 for all magnitudes == M
search_radius:
 minmag: 6 # min magnitude
 maxmag: 7 # max magnitude
 minmag_radius: 3 # search radius for min mag (deg)
 maxmag_radius: 3 # search radius for max mag (deg)

# Data (waveform segments) https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.1.pdf#page=8
# ========================

# data-select web service to use (url). It *must* be FDSN compliant:
# <site>/fdsnws/dataselect/<majorversion>/query
# otherwise the station query can not be retrieved automatically
# (the site scheme is optional and will default to 'http://' in case.
# An ending '/' or '?' will be removed from the url, if present).
# You can also type two special values:
# "iris" (shortcut for: https://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query) or
# "eida" (which will automatically fetch data from the urls of all EIDA datacenters).
# Implementation details: If the station web service(s) did not return data
# (e.g., connection problems), then the requested stations and channales will be fetched from the
# database. In this case, if the database is empty the download process will stop with an error
# message.
dataws: 'eida'

# The model to be used to asses the travel times of a wave from
# the event location to each station location. Type a string denoting a file name (absolute path)
# of a custom model created by means of `s2s utils ttcreate` or one of the 4 built-in models
# (all assuming receiver depth=0 for simplicity):
# ak135_ttp+: ak135 model pre-computed for all ttp+ phases (P wave arrivals)
# ak135_tts+: ak135 model pre-computed for all tts+ phases (S wave arrivals)
# iasp91_ttp+: iasp91 model pre-computed for all ttp+ phases (P wave arrivals)
# iasp91_tts+: iasp91 model pre-computed for all tts+ phases (S wave arrivals)
# For each segment, the arrival time (travel time + event time) will be the pivot
# whereby the user sets up the download time window (see also 'timespan').
# Implementation details: the *max* error on the arrival times (assessed on a random set of points)
# using one of the pre-computed models is in the order of 0.5 seconds.
traveltimes_model: 'ak135_ttp+'

# The segment's time span (i.e., the data time window to download): specify two positive floats denoting 
# the minutes to account for before and after the calculated arrival time. Note that 3.5 means
# 3 minutes 30 seconds, and that each segment window will be eventually rounded to the nearest
# second to avoid floating point errors when checking for segments to re-download because of a
# changed window.
timespan:
 - 1.0 # start time of the waveform segment to download, in minutes *before* the calculated arrival time.
 - 3.0 # end time of the waveform segment to download, in minutes *after* the calculated arrival time

# this parameter sets the credentials in order to download restricted data. It can be:
# - a single string pointing to a token file for restricted data authorization if "dataws" is "eida") 
#   (https://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de/waveform/archive/auth/auth-overview.php). Non-absolute
#   paths will be relative to the config file they are written in.
# - a list of two strings denoting username and password
# when this parameter is null, or the empty string, only open (unrestricted) waveform data will
# be downloaded. When provided, restricted segments previosuly downloaded with no credentials
# (thus, with no waveform data) will be always re-downloaded regardless of the retry_* parameters.
